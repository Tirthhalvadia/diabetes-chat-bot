Project Title:
Diabetes chat bot

Problem Statement/Opportunity:
537 million adults (20-79 years) are living with diabetes, or in other words every 1 in 10 is a diabetic patient. So this project aims at making everyone aware about the results of various kind of diabetic tests and also help them and suggest what to do in order to be healthy and hence preventing further risks. 

Project Description:
This project will make people clear as to what does those figures in various diabetes test suggest. So here I have made a chat bot which makes people choose between 3 tests which they have taken earlier and then further ends up showing whether they are diabetic, pre-diabetic or a healthy patient. If they are pre-diabetic or diabetic patient then answer is followed by a link which further guides them in order to avoid further complications.
